\chapter{Introduction}
Software used by the scientific community for propagating the time dependent Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE), 
is usually written in ancient FORTRAN, without any concern for proper software enginering.

I propose pyprop, a farily general framework for developing propagation schemes for TDSE-like 
initial value problems. Having a standard framework taking care of parallelization (yet to be implemented), 
loading and saving the wavefunction, set up of a numerical experiment and more, makes it easier to test 
and develop new propagation schemes. 

Propagators for N-dimensional cartesian coordinates, as well as 3D spherical coordinates are included 
in the standard package.

Pyprop is written in Python and C++ (depending heavily on the numpy module in python, and the
blitz++ array library in C++). It uses boost::python as the interface between C++ and Python, 
and pyste to automate the tedious task of writing boost::python interface code.

Pyprop is licenced under the GPL, and hosted on Google Code. http://www.
